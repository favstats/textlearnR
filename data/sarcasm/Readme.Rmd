* [Kaggle Challange](https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/sarcasm#train-balanced-sarcasm.csv)

This dataset contains 1.3 million Sarcastic comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit. The dataset was generated by scraping comments from Reddit (not by me :)) containing the \s ( sarcasm) tag. This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content.


```{r, eval = T}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
sarcasm_dat <- read_csv("train-balanced-sarcasm.csv") %>% 
  select(label, comment) %>% 
  glimpse

sarcasm_dat %>% 
  count(label)

# save(sarcasm_dat, file = "sarcasm_dat.Rdata")
```
